# PokerICS4U

This project was made to complete the CPT for ICS4U, where I chose to make a version of poker that runs within the console. As such, certain classes, including the Card, Deck, Hand, and TextIO classes were provided. The game logic was created by myself, under the constraints that I use concepts learned in the course.

It is also worth noting that this project code was written over a 3-4 day period in June 2023. As such, I am sure some of the code could be refactored and improved with continued development.
